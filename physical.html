      1.2- Here are some food recommendations that can provide the necessary nutrients for the healthy growth and development of children aged 3-6:

      1.2.1-Fruits and vegetables: Encourage your child to eat a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables every day. This will provide them with essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber. You can offer them as snacks or include them in meals. <br>

      1.2.2-Lean proteins: Include lean meats such as chicken and turkey, fish, eggs, beans, lentils, and tofu in your child's diet. These foods are rich in protein which is important for building muscle and supporting the immune system. <br>

      1.2.3-Whole grains: Choose whole grain bread, pasta, rice, and cereal products instead of refined grains. They contain more fiber, vitamins, and minerals that support growth and development. <br>

    <p id="fourth-pre">
      Sports and physical activities are an important part of a child's growth and development. Here are some examples of sports games that are suitable for children between the ages of 3 to 6 years old: <br>

      1-Running games: Simple running games like tag or relay races can help children develop their gross motor skills, balance and coordination.<br>

      2-Ball games: Playing with soft balls or beach balls can be fun for young children and help them develop hand-eye coordination. Games like catch, rolling the ball back and forth, or kicking a ball back and forth can also be enjoyable.<br>

      3-Dancing: Encourage your child to dance to music or follow along with simple dance routines. This can improve their balance, flexibility, and strength.<br>

      4-Obstacle courses: Use furniture, pillows, blankets, and other household items to create a simple obstacle course. This can challenge children's motor planning skills and spatial awareness.<br>

      5-Hula hooping: Using a lightweight hula hoop can be a fun way to improve coordination and balance.<br>

      6-Swimming: If safe and supervised, swimming can be a great way for children to strengthen their muscles and cardiovascular system.<br>

      Remember to always supervise young children during physical activity and choose age-appropriate activities that don't pose a risk of injury. <br>
